# I Don't Want To Hear Your Virus
A virus thing in C that loops the lyrics for the Faith song "Don't Tell Me". Make sure to use ^C so your computer doesn't go boom. Also listen to the song, because it's so good. Actually, listen to the whole album. Actually, listen to the whole Faith/Void split LP.
